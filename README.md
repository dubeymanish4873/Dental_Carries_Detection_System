# Introduction
Dental caries, commonly known as cavities, are among the most prevalent dental issues affecting people worldwide. Accurate and timely detection of dental caries is essential for effective treatment planning and overall oral health management. Traditionally, dental professionals rely on visual examination and radiographic imaging to identify caries. However, manual interpretation of these images can be subjective, time-consuming, and prone to human error. To address these challenges, our project focuses on leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for the automated detection of dental caries from radiographic images.

Dental caries can develop in various parts of the teeth and at different stages of progression, ranging from initial demineralization to advanced decay involving the pulp. Differentiating between these stages is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment strategy and prognosis. However, the variability in image quality, differences in radiographic techniques, and the subtle nature of early caries make manual detection difficult and inconsistent. Automated systems based on deep learning techniques offer a promising solution to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

The model, renowned for its computational efficiency and superior performance, is ideally suited for medical image analysis tasks. By utilizing deep learning and transfer learning techniques, we aim to develop a robust and precise system capable of automatically identifying and classifying dental caries with high accuracy and reliability. This automated approach can assist dental professionals by providing consistent and objective caries detection, ultimately leading to improved patient care and treatment outcomes.

 Image plays a vital role in dental diagnostics, offering detailed and non-invasive visualization of the internal structures of teeth. However, the manual interpretation of these images requires specialized expertise and is susceptible to inter-observer variability. Automated systems powered by advanced deep learning models can mitigate these issues by delivering accurate and consistent detection results, thereby supporting dental practitioners in making informed decisions.

In summary, this project aims to leverage cutting-edge technologies to address the critical challenge of dental caries detection. By integrating automated analysis of radiographic images, we seek to enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce the burden on dental professionals, and ultimately improve oral health outcomes. The insights gained from this research have the potential to revolutionize dental diagnostics and contribute to the advancement of digital health solutions in dentistry.
